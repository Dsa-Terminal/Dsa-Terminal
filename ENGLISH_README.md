**Dsa Terminal** is a simulator of Gnu/Linux Bash for Windows 10 users!
Totally in portuguese and with an excellent text formating can do a lot more things than the own Ubuntu!

## Requirements
You dont't need to install Python, so if you wanna do that you can install and execute `Setup.bat` in the first time and afteronly click `Terminal.py` to execute!
