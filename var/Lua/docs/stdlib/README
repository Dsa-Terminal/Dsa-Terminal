                        ----------------------

     by the stdlib project (http://luaforge.net/projects/stdlib/)


This is a collection of Lua libraries for Lua 5.1, with provisional
support for Lua 5.2. The libraries are copyright by their authors
2000-2011 (see the AUTHORS file for details), and released under the
MIT license (the same license as Lua itself). There is no warranty.

The standard subset of stdlib has no prerequisites beyond a standard
Lua 5.1 system. The following modules have extra dependencies:

  fstable: Lua 5.2


Installation
------------

Copy the contents of the modules directory into a location on your
LUA_PATH.


Use
---

As well as requiring individual libraries, you can load the standard
set with

  require "std"

Modules not in the standard set may be removed from future versions of
stdlib.


Documentation
-------------

The libraries are documented in LuaDoc. Pre-built HTML files are
included.


Bug reports and code contributions
----------------------------------

Please make bug reports on LuaForge (see URL at top of file).

There is also a mailing list for discussing the libraries,
stdlib-users@lists.luaforge.net. You can subscribe on the project
page.

These libraries are maintained and extended by their users. If you'd
like to contribute, please write to the mailing list, or post code on
the patch tracker.
