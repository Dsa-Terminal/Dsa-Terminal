Run the test as:

<your Lua+LuaTask path>/lua test.lua

You will get a "TEST>" prompt.

At that prompt you can use the followings commands:

ts : Shows the task list.

quit : Exit the program.

run script [arg1 [..., argN]] : Runs script [with arguments].


Using:
    run test2.lua [count [delay]]
you can see a simple timed test.


test3.lua : 508 subtask verification.

test4.lua : same as test3 but using a string with task.create()

test5.lua : same as test3 but using a binary chunk with task.create()


Enjoy it,
